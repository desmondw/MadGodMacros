Mad God Macros
=============

This is a script I wrote for the game Realm of the Mad God. It adds functionality such as binding functionality to the side mouse buttons, quick potting, quick porting, quick chat selection, and most importantly quick looting. I wrote this a while ago out of necessity when the game didn't bind any drops and the fastest clicker got the loot. The mouse-driven selection is powered by image picking so the script won't likely hold up anymore as they've likely changed the interface.
